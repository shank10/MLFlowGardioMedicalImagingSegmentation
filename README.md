Medical Image Segmentation with Gradio

    Objective: Develop a deep learning model for segmenting medical images (e.g., MRI or CT scans) to identify regions like tumors or organs. 
	This task is widely used in medical diagnosis and requires accurate segmentation for better decision-making.

    Project Outline:
        Data: Use a publicly available dataset of medical images like the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset - 
		      https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats2020-training-data/discussion/192133.
        Model: Implement a U-Net or another segmentation model using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
        Pipeline:
            Use MLflow to track different models and hyperparameters, experimenting with image preprocessing, augmentations, and different architectures.
            Store metrics such as dice coefficient, IOU (Intersection Over Union), and validation loss in MLflow for each experiment.
        Deployment with Gradio:
            Deploy the trained model as an interactive Gradio application, where users can upload their own medical images to see segmentation results.
            Add functionalities like overlay toggles, confidence scores, and save/download options for segmented images.
